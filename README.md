grader
======

I am a novice grader. You might want me to grade homeworks. OK, I need tools for grading so you need to do following.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/sangheestyle/grader
$ cd grader
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to do following to get the result.
```
$ $ time python grading.py --id sangheestyle --begin_n 1 --end_n 9 --o grade_sheet1-9.pkl
```
